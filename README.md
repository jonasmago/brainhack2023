## Usage

### Building the book

If you'd like to develop on and build the to-do list for procrastinators, you should:

- Clone this repository and run
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (it is recommended you do this within a virtual environment)
- Run `jb build how_todo-procrastinators/`

A fully-rendered HTML version of the book will be built in `todo-procrastinators/_build/html/`.

### Hosting the book

The html version of the book is hosted on the `gh-pages` branch of this repo. Navigate to your local build and run,
- `ghp-import -n -p -f todo-procrastinators/_build/html`

This will automatically push your build to the `gh-pages` branch. More information on this hosting process can be found [here](https://jupyterbook.org/publish/gh-pages.html#manually-host-your-book-with-github-pages).

## Contributors

This text was put together by P. Bellec, drawing inspiration from many places. The first inspiration in the book "_The Art of Procrastination: A Guide to Effective Dawdling, Lollygagging and Postponing_" by Professor Emeritus John Perry from Stanford University. [Printed copies](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Procrastination-Effective-Lollygagging-Postponing/dp/0761171673/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1344889395&sr=1-1) of this excellent book are available for sales, and a short version is available on the author's [website](http://www.structuredprocrastination.com/). The second inspiration is the videogame [Celeste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeste_(video_game)).
