    "- for comparing nilearn and spm beta maps: specify not-matched. E.g.:\n",
    "   - between software, within subject, within contrast, within run \n",
    "   - between software, between subject, between contrast, between run \n",
    "- feature selection must be either on (A) train set or (B) integrated in cross-validation. Make sure it's not selecting featuers on the entier dataset --> danger of overfitting!\n",
    "- r2 is a measure for the percentage of variance explained. Not relevant here, thus, remove it. \n",
    "- explain permutation test for significance testing.\n",
    "- apply the classifer on beta maps per trials (there are 10 trials per run). I can use ROIs or entire beta masks. The model will take care of the many variables. \n",
    "- try a searchlight appraoch: train a classifer on different ROIs or voxels and then compare the accuracy. This could lead to a accuracy map with voxel resolution, however, this is computationally expensive. \n",
    "- it's important to  **de-mean** my data before doing this (e.g. use z-score). \n",
    "- look into **stratified cross validation** to deal with multiple runs per subject in the classifier. If I use stratification this shouldn't be a problem."
